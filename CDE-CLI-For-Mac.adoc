* Make sure that the cde file is executable by running the below command. 
```
chmod +x /path/to/cde
```
* Open the CDE CLI. You might get the below error. 
* If "cde" cannot be opened - Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy and add this app in the trust center. 
* Once done, add the path to the cli in the PATH variable. 
* Run the below command in the terminal to update the path variable. 
```
	export PATH=$PATH:”<path-to-cde>”
```
* Example : If the file is situated in the path
```
/home/user/applications/cde
```
* Then the export command will look something like this
```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/applications/
```
**Note : Once the terminal is closed, the  step to add the path to the PATH variable needs to be performed again.**

* To validate the installation, run the below command from the terminal. 
```
cde --help
```
* If you get a result, then the installation is completed successfully. We now need to configure the CLI to connect to our virtual cluster. 
* For configuring the CDE CLI, we create a new file and add the cluster details and use it as an environment variable for connecting to the CDE virtual cluster. 
* Create a file as config.yaml and add the following details. 
* Here, user is the username you have been assigned. DO NOT INCLUDE “@workshop.com” as part of user (example: user: wuser01)
* Use the Jobs API URL for the virtual cluster.
```
touch config.yaml
```
```
vi config.yaml
```
```
user: <CDP_user>
vcluster-endpoint: <CDE_virtual_cluster_endpoint>
```

* Open terminal and run the below command to create an environment variable. 
```
export CDE_CONFIG=/path/to/config.yaml
```
* Run the below command to verify whether the above step is completed successfully. You should see the path-to-config.yaml as the output. 
```
echo $CDE_CONFIG
```
* Run the below command to validate the configuration. Upon running it, you will be asked to provide the API password. Please enter the password as mentioned in the excel sheet. 
```
cde job list
```
* Once you enter the password, you should see all the jobs present in the virtual cluster. 
If you get any  error related to the certificate, please add the flag to skip tls verification. 
```
cde job list --tls-insecure
```
* This marks the end of installation and configuration of CDE CLI. Now, head over to the next lab to trigger the jobs from CLI.
