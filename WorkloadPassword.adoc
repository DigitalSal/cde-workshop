=== Step 1(b): Define CDP Workload Password

*`Suggestion:`* `Ideal way to work through this workshop will be to have 2 Incognitio mode browers opened. One to be used in a way that you can follow instructions using GitHub and the other one to be used for the workshop related screens.` +

Please use the login URL provided by instructor. +
Enter the `Workshop Login Username` and `Workshop Login Password` shared by your instructor. +

(*Note*: Note that your username would be something like `wuser00@workshop.com` and not just `wuser00`). +

You will need to define your `CDP Workload Password` that will be used to acess non-SSO interfaces. You may read more about it https://docs.cloudera.com/management-console/cloud/user-management/topics/mc-access-paths-to-cdp.html[here].
Please keep it with you. If you have forgotten it, you will be able to repeat this process and define another one.

. Click on your `user name (Ex: wuser00@workshop.com`) at the lower left corner.

Check that you got the message - `Workload password is currently set` or alternatively, look for a message next to `Workload Password` which says `(Workload password is currently set)`
